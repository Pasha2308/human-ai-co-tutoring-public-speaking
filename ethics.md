# Ethical Considerations

This research prototype is designed with explicit ethical constraints.

## Human Accountability
Final mastery decisions are made by a human validator.
Automated systems cannot independently certify skill mastery.

## Constrained Automation
AI evaluation is limited to objective and explainable metrics such as
speech duration and filler word usage.

The system does not assess:
- Emotional state
- Confidence
- Charisma
- Persuasiveness

## Transparency
Learners are informed when automated evaluation is used
and when human validation is required.

## Data Handling
Audio data is used only for evaluation within the prototype.
No biometric identification or affective inference is performed.
